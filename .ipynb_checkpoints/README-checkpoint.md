# Abstract
<!-- Describe your idea in 3 or 4 sentences -->
Turnips are basically the Animal Crossing: New Horizons version of the stock market - adorably known as the stalk market. 
You buy turnips for one price, hold onto them, and then sell them for, hopefully, more than you paid for them.
So forecasting Turnip Prices with the Bayesian network using quantum circuit will be a simple but interesting project.


# Description 

According to the official Animal Crossing guide book, the fluctuations in turnips prices each week follows one of four patterns: Normal, Sudden Spike, Gradual Decline, and Gentle Spike.
Using some information from the guide book and some research from communities, we will design the bayesian network with quantum circuit.
